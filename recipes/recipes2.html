    <ul>
        <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>16 ounce penne pasta</li>
        <li>6 cups cube cooked chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil in a small bowl until evenly moistened; set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</li>
